	 <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	 <p>
		Time complexity is a crucial concept in computer science that helps determine how efficient an algorithm is in terms of the time it takes to execute. Efficient algorithms are designed to solve problems with minimal time consumption, especially as the input size grows.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		<b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. For example, an algorithm that uses a linear amount of memory will have a space complexity of O(n). Understanding <b>Space Complexity</b> helps in designing programs that use memory efficiently.
